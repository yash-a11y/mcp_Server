## Running Goose with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If you're using WSL and face issues running Goose sessions, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Shell Script

Inside your WSL terminal, create a file named `run-extension.sh`:

```bash
nano run-extension.sh
```

Paste the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
java -jar "FULL_PATH_OF_JAR_FILE/target/mcp_feature-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
```

>  Replace `FULL_PATH_OF_JAR_FILE` with the actual path to your JAR file.

### 2. Ensure Java is Installed in WSL

If you encounter issues related to Java, ensure JDK is installed:

```bash
java -version
```

If not installed, you can install OpenJDK via:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
```

### 3. Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x run-extension.sh
```

### 4. Start Goose Session with Your Extension

```bash
goose session --with-extension="./run-extension.sh"
```

You're now ready to run your Spring Boot application integrated with MCP and the Goose AI Agent! ðŸ§ ðŸš€
